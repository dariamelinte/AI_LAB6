# Laboratory 5: Game theory

## Authors: Melinte Daria & Giosu Stefana - E3

### Problem:

Implement a program capable of playing "Number Scrabble". Two players alternately choose a number between 1 and 9 without repeating a number previously chosen by either player. The player who has chosen from the beginning of the game three numbers that add up to a total of 15 wins. If no more numbers can be chosen and no player has won, the game ends in a draw. 

Example: A:3 B:9 A:5 B:7 A:2 B:8 A:4 B:1 A:6 A wins (6+5+4) 

### Steps:

1. Represent a state, initializing it, checking the final state.
2. Implement the transition and its validation.
3. Implement a heuristic.
4. Implement the MinMax strategy for player B anticipating at least two opponent moves.
